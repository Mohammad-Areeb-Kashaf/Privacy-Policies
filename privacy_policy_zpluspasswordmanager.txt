Privacy Policy for Z+ Password Manager

Last Updated: May 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Z+ Password Manager ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information. Z+ Password Manager is committed to protecting your privacy.

1. Our Commitment to Your Privacy and Security

Z+ Password Manager is designed with your privacy and security as its absolute top priority. We understand the sensitive nature of the data you entrust to a password manager.

* Zero-Knowledge Encryption: All your passwords and sensitive information are encrypted on your device using a combination of your unique master password (passphrase) and your user ID (UID). This encryption happens before any data leaves your device. We do not have access to your master password or your unencrypted data. This means even if our cloud database (Firebase) were ever compromised, your encrypted data would remain unreadable to us or any unauthorized third party, as your master password (which we never store) is required for decryption.
* Encrypted Cloud Sync (Firebase): Your encrypted password data is synced to and stored securely on Firebase. This allows you to access your passwords across multiple devices and provides a backup. While the data itself is stored in the cloud, it remains encrypted and unreadable to us.
* Passphrase Management & Limited Recovery:
    * We do not store or have any means to recover your master password (or passphrase) ourselves.
    * However, in future updates, we plan to introduce a limited passphrase recovery feature. This feature will only work on a device where you are currently logged in and still have access to your decrypted passwords. This process involves decrypting your data locally on that trusted device, setting a new master password, and then re-encrypting and re-uploading your entire vault with the new master password. This functionality does NOT allow us, or any third party, to access your data or master password. It relies entirely on your ability to decrypt data on an already authorized device.
    * If you lose your master password and do not have any device where you are currently logged in and can access your passwords, we will be unable to help you recover your encrypted data. Please ensure you keep your master password in a safe and memorable place.
* Data Residence: Your data is stored on Firebase's servers. Firebase stores data in Google Cloud data centers, which may be located in various regions globally.

2. Information We Do Not Collect

* Your Raw Passwords and Sensitive Data: As stated above, we never collect, store, or have access to your actual, unencrypted passwords, usernames, notes, or any other sensitive data you store within Z+ Password Manager. This information is encrypted on your device before being transmitted to Firebase.
* Your Master Password: We do not know or store your master password. As a consequence, if you forget your master password and do not have a device where you are already logged in and able to access your vault, we cannot recover your data for you.

3. Information We May Collect (and why we collect it)

* a) Account Information (Firebase Authentication):
    * What: When you create an account, Firebase Authentication may collect your User ID (UID), email address (if you sign up with email), and possibly other authentication-related data provided by third-party sign-in providers (e.g., Google, Apple, if you use them).
    * Why: To create and manage your account within the App, link your encrypted data to your specific user account in Firebase, and facilitate cross-device sync.
    * How: This is handled by Google Firebase Authentication. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for more details on their data handling practices.
* b) Encrypted Password Data (Firebase Firestore/Realtime Database):
    * What: Your encrypted passwords and associated metadata (e.g., URL, username, notes) are stored in your private section of our Firebase database. This data is incomprehensible without your master password.
    * Why: To enable secure cloud backup and cross-device synchronization of your password vault.
    * How: Stored in Firebase Firestore or Realtime Database, linked to your user UID.
* c) Crash Reports and Analytics (Optional):
    * What: Anonymous crash logs (e.g., stack traces) and general usage statistics (e.g., app launch count, feature usage frequency). This data is typically anonymized and aggregated.
    * Why: To help us identify and fix bugs, improve app stability, understand which features are most used, and enhance the overall user experience. This data does NOT include your sensitive stored passwords or personal information.
    * How: We may use Google Firebase Crashlytics and Google Analytics for Firebase for this purpose. You may have the option to opt-out of analytics collection within the App's settings.
* d) Device Information (Limited):
    * What: Basic, non-identifying device information such as device model, operating system version, and screen resolution.
    * Why: To ensure compatibility, optimize performance, and debug issues specific to certain device configurations. This helps us ensure the App works well on a variety of devices.
* e) Payment Information (If applicable, for premium features):
    * What: If we introduce premium features that require payment, payment processing will be handled directly by the respective app store (Google Play Store, Apple App Store). We do not directly collect or store your credit card details or other financial information.
    * Why: To process your in-app purchases.
* f) Contact Information (If you contact support):
    * What: If you reach out to our support team (e.g., via email), you may provide your email address and any information you choose to include in your message.
    * Why: To communicate with you and provide customer support. This information is used solely for the purpose of addressing your query.

4. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

* To create and manage your user account.
* To enable secure cloud synchronization of your encrypted password data across your devices.
* To provide, maintain, and improve Z+ Password Manager's features and functionality.
* To troubleshoot and fix bugs, and improve app stability.
* To understand user behavior and optimize the user experience.
* To process payments for any premium features (handled by app stores).
* To communicate with you if you contact our support.

5. How We Share Your Information

We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We rely on Google Firebase for backend services (Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database, Crashlytics, Analytics). Your data, both authentication information and encrypted password data, resides on Firebase servers.

* Third-Party Services: We may share limited, anonymized, or aggregated data with other third-party service providers only for the purposes outlined above (e.g., analytics providers, crash reporting services, if any other than Firebase). These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which it was provided.
* Google Firebase: By using this App, you acknowledge and agree to the processing of your data by Google Firebase in accordance with their Privacy Policy. Google's Privacy Policy can be found at https://policies.google.com/privacy.
* Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights or property, or ensure the safety of our users or the public.
* Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, provided the acquiring entity agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

6. Data Security

We implement robust security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:

* Client-side encryption: All your sensitive data is encrypted on your device before being sent to Firebase.
* Firebase Security Rules: We configure Firebase security rules to ensure only authenticated users can access their own encrypted data.
* Secure development practices: We adhere to secure coding and development principles.
* Regular security reviews: We periodically review our security practices.

However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

7. Your Choices and Rights

* Accessing and Managing Your Data: All your password and sensitive data is encrypted by your master password and stored in Firebase. You have full control over this data through the App's interface, allowing you to view, edit, and delete your encrypted entries.
* Deleting Your Account: If you wish to delete your Z+ Password Manager account and all associated encrypted data from Firebase, please contact us at [Your Support Email Address Here]. We will guide you through the process. Deleting your account will permanently remove your encrypted data from our Firebase database.
* Opt-out of Analytics: You may have the option within the App's settings to opt-out of anonymous usage data collection.
* Uninstalling the App: You can uninstall the App at any time. Uninstalling the App will remove all locally cached data. If you have synced data to Firebase, it will remain there until you explicitly delete your account through the App or by contacting support.

8. Children's Privacy

Z+ Password Manager is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.

9. International Data Transfers

As we use Google Firebase, your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own, including the United States, where Google's data centers are located. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from those of your country. By using Z+ Password Manager, you consent to such transfer and processing of your information.

10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website (if applicable), and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
